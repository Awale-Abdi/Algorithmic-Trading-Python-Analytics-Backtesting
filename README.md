# Data-Driven Investment Strategy: Analyzing Financial Data for Portfolio Optimization

### **Overview**

This project applies Data Science techniques to financial data to design a profitable and robust investment strategy. By analyzing price behavior, volatility, and sector trends within the S&P 500, it identifies key patterns for optimal portfolio selection. The workflow includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, sector-level insights, and the development of a backtested investment strategy. Using Python, pandas, NumPy, and statistical metrics such as CAGR, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio, the project demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance investment decision-making and portfolio performance.

### **Structure of Workflow**

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, transforming, and structuring stock price and sector data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating stock distributions, trends, and initial volatility insights.
- **Deeper Data Analysis:** Evaluating price behavior, volatility, and sector distributions to identify strong investment candidates.
- **Backtesting Chosen Strategy:** Implementing a rule-based investment approach and benchmarking it against the S&P 500.
- **Conclusion:** Wrapping up my final findings and evaluating the chosen strategy's performance and what it says about a data-driven approach to portfolio optimization.

### **Tools & Techniques Used**

- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Financial Metrics:** CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Volatility, Calmar Ratio
- **Backtesting Methodology:** Simulated healthcare portfolio selections with 1,000 iterative comparisons against the S&P 500 (2010-2024)

### **Key Findings**

The healthcare sector emerged as a strong investment choice due to its balance of stability and returns.
The backtested portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 in 60% of cases while limiting downside risks.
Even when underperforming, the portfolio only lagged the S&P by ~20%, but when winning, it exceeded it by ~40%.
Risk-adjusted metrics like Sharpe and Sortino ratios confirmed the portfolioâ€™s superior risk-return tradeoff.


### **The project includes interactive visualizations to display**

- Sector-based stock price distributions and volatility trends
- Cohort-wise performance breakdowns for various price groups
- Cumulative returns over time for the healthcare portfolio vs. the S&P 500

### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a systematic, data-driven approach to investment strategy development. By using financial data analysis and backtesting, I validate an investment method that not only beats the market more often than not but does so with controlled risk and strong stability. The methodology and insights can be extended to other sectors or refined further for improved accuracy and this project overall showcases how useful data science can be for portfolio management.

### **Future Improvements**

- Implement Monte Carlo simulations to model risk scenarios.

- Explore alternative asset classes (bonds, commodities, cryptocurrencies).

- Apply machine learning models for predictive insights and for optimizing the strategy's performance.

### **How to Use**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Awale-Abdi/Algorithmic_Trading_Healthcare_Portfolio
```
#### 2. Have the Datasets present in your working directory

The analyses rely on the following three datasets being present in your working directory:

- sp500_companies.csv
- sp500_index.csv
- sp500_stocks.parquet
  
You must have all these files present in your working directory for the Python Notebook to run without errors. They are loaded via relative paths, so as long as they are in your working directory, everything should work fine.

#### **3. Run the Python Notebook**
Run Python in the Jupyter Notebook format, download the datasets into your working directory then run the following notebook:
