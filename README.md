# Algorithmic_Trading_Healthcare_Portfolio
Stretching my legs and staying on top of the Algorithmic trading skills I learned at Hult International Business School under Professor Michael Rolleigh. Managed to create an impressive investment strategy that outperformed the S&amp;P500 through ~60% of the backtests via Data analysis. Didn't even need to use Machine Learning models.
